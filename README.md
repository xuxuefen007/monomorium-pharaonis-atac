ATAC-seq analysis of chromatin accessibility underlying caste differentiation in Monomorium pharaonis

# Outline

### `developmental_heatmap.R` 
**Main Analysis Script**: Generates chromatin accessibility heatmaps showing dynamic changes across developmental stages from embryo_0_12h to larva_1st. This script performs differential peak analysis, DESeq2 normalization, and visualizes top variable peaks in a publication-quality heatmap.
